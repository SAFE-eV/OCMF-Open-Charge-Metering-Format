## General

### Goal

The aim of this concept is to describe an independent and generally usable data format for recording meter readings from charging stations that are relevant under calibration law. Furthermore, this concept can serve as a basis for discussion for utilization in the DKE. In addition, it is to serve for the implementation of the evaluation and signature verification of the format by the transparency software to be created within the SAFE initiative.

At the time of writing, no uniform data format for the transmission of signed meter readings has been adopted at the standardization level. A corresponding application guideline is currently being developed. The presented data format originates from an internal draft of ABL and was discussed with has.to.be and KEBA.

A uniform format brings the advantage of interoperability and enables uniform verification software at the operator and the end user. The concept presented here is based on the end-to-end security concept for a custody transfer ("GL") solution for the transmission of measurement data to remote displays by Dr. Martin Kahmann [MEMOGL]. It further builds on ABL's internal concept for legal metrology compliance.

This document is structured as follows: First, a classification and presentation of the transmission of the
data format is given, in the further sections the data format is explained.

## Transmission of signed meter readings

### Embedding in OCPP

OCPP version 1.5 already allows the simultaneous transmission of any number of MeterValue objects as part of the MeterValue.req and StopTransaction.req messages. Each such object may in turn have a timestamp noted along with one or more meter reading values. Each value may optionally be accompanied by attributes, one of which is of the ValueFormat enum type, which has two possible values:

 * Raw: Data is to be interpreted as integer/decimal numeric data.
 * SignedData: Data is represented as a signed binary data block, encoded as hex data.

_Source: [OCPP 1.5]_

This makes it possible to continue to use the functionality provided by OCPP and to combine it with the possibility of transmitting signed meter values.

The data format presented here is therefore intended for parallel transmission of such a SignedData "value" in addition to the previous raw values.

While the reading of the previous values may be based on a time that does not conform to the calibration law (OCPP-based), the signed meter values are based on a time that does not conform to the calibration law.
however, the signed meter values are based on one. Even the two resulting times can be correctly represented separately in two MeterValue objects.

This mechanism is used in the context of:

 - Start of a transaction (StartTransaction)
 - Readings during a transaction (MeterValues)
 - End of transaction (StopTransaction)
 - Charge Data Record over the whole transaction with values at start and end (optional)
 - Readings for so-called "Fiscal Metering" (MeterValuesAlignedData): Here, no reference to ongoing transactions is recorded, but only the absolute meter values of all charge points at previously determined points in time.

It should be noted that, as a rule, the following readings are relevant under calibration law:

 - Start and end value in relation to the charging transaction
 - Tariff change (common practice only at the quarter hour of the clock).

Thus the following OCPP configuration is typically useful:

 - ClockAlignedDataInterval=900 (15min)
 - MeterValuesAlignedData=Active.Energy.Register.Import
 - Controller software takes care of generating additional MeterValues with signed values at the start and end of the charging process beyond the simple integer value that can be part of the StartTransaction/StopTransaction messages.

### Signing and verification process

In order to verify a data set, the data that has been signed must first be restored to its original form.
original form. A hash calculation is performed on this original form. The result is verified via the digital signature using ECDSA.

To produce the original form, the header and signature are separated from the data record. If necessary, the public key is verified via a separate transmission path.

This means that the signature and the public key are shown separately in the unified data record.

The cohesion between several individual data records is ensured by continuous pagination.
is guaranteed. In addition to the signature, this must be verified by a check component. The first record
must be marked as the start of a loading process, the last as the end of the loading process. In between
no data records may have been removed or added. Likewise, intermediate
error conditions (error counters) and the detection of unusable variables must lead to an error during the
test. Furthermore, all data records must come from the same source (serial number).



## Data format
The data format should be as simple as possible and comprehensible by the experienced user. From
a modular data format is desirable, so that future extensions can be implemented.
can be implemented. Another concern is to make the verification process as generic as possible, i.e. also
applicable to other source formats. For this reason, a header section was included in the format.

The format consists of several sections:

1. **Header** to uniquely identify the format.
2. section containing the actual **payload data**.
3. **Signature** over the payload data

The contents of the record serve as the input format into the [Link](https://transparenz.software/ transparency software). The [Link](https://transparenz.software/ transparency software) is available online for anyone to use to validate the dataset.

In the following chapters, the data format for the representation and transmission of the signed meter values is defined.

## JSON-based OCMF format

JSON notation was chosen for the individual sections of the format for better readability and easier traceability. To save data volume, the following measures were taken:

 - Identifiers are kept short (since some need explanation anyway, not much clarity is lost here
lost)
 - In some places encapsulation was deliberately omitted. Instead, the identifiers are canonicalized.

The sections within the data format are separated with the special character "|". Within the sections the format corresponds to the JSON notation. Thus, the use of the special character "|" is not allowed within the sections.

The fact that the format can be enriched according to the JSON notation with spaces and line feeds at
can be enriched with spaces and line feeds at any position, called white space, for display purposes.
also makes it easier for a user to read.

Between signing and validation, the payload section must not be manipulated (removing and adding white spaces), otherwise positive validation is not possible.

In the following, the different sections of the format are explained. Furthermore, an example is given.

### Sections

At the beginning of the format there is a header for unique identification of the format.
The user data section and the signature section follow, separated by pipe characters.
This results in the following structure for the sections:

    OCMF|<payload data section>|<signature section>

The words payload data section and signature section are to be replaced by the contents of the respective sections.


#### Header

The header is used to uniquely identify the transmission format. In the case of OCMF, the string "OCMF" must be specified in this section.

#### Payload data section

The payload data section consists of a JSON object. This contains several value mappings or
sub-objects. The contents of the payload data section must not be modified between signing and verification of the signature.

##### General information

The information in this section refers primarily to the signature-generating component, which is referred to here as the gateway for the sake of simplicity. Depending on the structure, it may be more appropriate to refer to the measuring capsule or the signing component.

<small>Table 1: General information fields</small>

##### Pagination

The pagination indicates the reference to a transaction and arranges the total data record in the stream of the
readings via the meters in a comprehensible way. Several contexts are available for pagination,
each context has its own counter reading. The respective pagination counter is counted monotonically in ascending order with an increment of 1. That means, successive values of the pagination counter count continuously in the space of natural numbers.

The transaction context (T) must be supported in any case. The fiscal context (F) is optional and can be supported by the signature component as an option if signed readings outside of transactions are desired.

| PG | String |1..1 | Pagination of the entire data set, i.e. the data that are combined in one signature. Format: `<indicator><number>` <br> The string is composed of an identifying letter for the context and a number without leading zeros. There is a separate independent pagination counter for each context. The following indicators are defined: <br>  T: Transaction – Readings in transaction reference (mandatory) <br> F: Fiscal – Readings independent of transactions (optional) <br> The respective pagination counter is incremented after each use for a record.|

##### Readings

One or more readings can be stored in a record. Each reading is encapsulated in a sub-object. These objects are noted as an array under the key "RD" for Reading(s). This array thus contains one or more anonymous objects.
Each of these objects is constructed as described in Table 6.
For the readings, fields that have an identical value to the previous reading are omitted. However, this only applies within a signed record. This means concretely that, for example, only in the first sub-object the field "RI" is defined with a value (here the OBIS code) and is thus valid for all further readings. Likewise, for example, the field "TX" can be defined in the first sub-object as `B`, in the second as `C`, in the last with `E`, which means that the readings three to the penultimate take the value `C`.
The fields `RV`, `RI` , `RU` and `RT` can be omitted if only the occurrence of an error condition (event) of the meter is to be indicated.
The fields `RI` and `RU`, form a group. Fields of a group are either all present together or omitted together. 
A power failure during time-based billing represents an error event.

Month, day, hour, minute and second is displayed with two digits. Millisecond is displayed with three digits. The indication of the time zone consists of a sign and a four-digit indication for hour and minute. Example: <br> `2018-07-24T13:22:04,000+0200` <br> The synchronization state consists of a capital letter as identifier. This is added to the time, separated by a space.

| RV   | Number |1..1| Reading-Value: The value of the reading <br>Here the JSON data format Number is used, this allows among other things an exact marking of the valid decimal places. However, the representation must not be transformed by further handling methods (e.g. processing by JSON parser) (rewriting the number with a different exponent, truncation of decimal places, etc.) since this would change the representation of the physical quantity and thus potentially the number of valid digits. According to the application rule, it is recommended to represent the measured value with two decimal places of accuracy, if it is kWh.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

##### Extension points in payload data section

In the payload data section it may be necessary for different manufacturers to be able to add their own data.
their own data. For this purpose, the following extension points are reserved in the namespace of the JSON object for free use depending on the manufacturer:

 * Reserved are all top-level names in the JSON object of the user data section, which start with the following letters:
   - U
   - V
   - W
   - X
   - Y
   - Z
 * Since no changes or additions can be made subsequently in the user data section (sic), no corresponding extension points are defined. [See below](#extension points signature section).


#### Signature section

##### Extension points

Analogous to the extension points in section 0, unprotected extension points may also be
desirable. The following are reserved for this purpose:

 * Reserved for vendor use are all top-level names in the signature data section JSON object that begin with the following letters:
	- U
	- V
	- W
	- X
	- Y
	- Z
 * The following initial letters are reserved accordingly for use by components in subsequent processing of data:
     - A
	 - B
	 - C
	 - D
	 - E
	 - F

#### Reference of serial numbers, charge point and public key

To establish a reference between the public key to be used for signature verification and the
one or more serial numbers; alternatively, the loading point can also be identified directly by ID.
alternatively, the charging point can be identified directly by ID.

The public keys to the charging point must be transmitted to the verification component by means other than this protocol (out-of-band) in conjunction with the ID or serial numbers used, e.g. via a central register.

To uniquely identify a signature component, the following characteristics are defined in this protocol:

 - If the signature component is attributable to the energy meter, its serial number is sufficient.
 - If the signature component itself is the gateway and only one charging point is served, the serial number of the gateway or the energy meter is sufficient.
 - If a gateway is responsible for more than one charging point, the combination of the serial numbers of the gateway and energy meter is used for unique identification.
 - Alternatively, a direct identification of the charge point can be made.

Since these conditions depend on the design of the charging station, the corresponding serial number fields are marked below as conditionally mandatory.

## Best practice - Additional OCPP configuration keys
To inform an OCPP backend about the behavior of a charging station the following additional OCPP configuration keys are recommended by S.A.F.E.


Additional Configuration Keys für OCPP:
* **StopTransactionSignatureFormat**: A signature over start and stop data OR separated (can be R or RW, depending on the implementation) This setting can take the following values:
    * **MR** MultipleReading (Start and stop in an OCMF data set)
    * **SR** SingleReading  (Start and stop in two separate OCMF data sets)
* **StopTransactionSignatureContexts**: ReadingContext from OCPP (CSL, RW). If the list is empty, all transaction records are transferred unsigned.
* **MeterValuesSignatureContexts**: Meter Values Trigger points for which signed OCMF records are to be generated.  Possible values see ReadingContext from OCPP (CSL, RW). If the list is empty, all MeterValues records are transmitted unsigned.
